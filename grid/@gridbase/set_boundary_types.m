function grid = set_boundary_types(grid,params)
%function grid = set_boundary_types(grid,params)
% function setting the boundary types of a polygonal grid.
%
% For ::rectgrid's this is already done in the constructor. For ::triagrid this
% can be performed explicitly here. Existing boundary settings are 'painted' by
% rectangles The edges with midpoints within such a rectangle are marked
% accordingly.
%
% required fields of params:
%    bnd_rect_corner1: coordinates of lower corner of to be marked
%              boundaries. This can also be cell array of coordinates for
%              drawing different rectangles.
%    bnd_rect_corner2: coordinates of upper corner of to be marked
%              boundaries. This can also be cell array of coordinates for
%              drawing different rectangles.
%    bnd_rect_index: integer index to be set on the edges in the above  defined
%            rectangle. Should not be positive integer in the range of the
%            number of elements. Use negative indices for certain later
%            discrimination.
%              - '-1' is treated as Dirichlet in the numerics
%              - '-2' is treated as Neumann in the numerics
%              .
%            This can also be a vector of the same length as the cell arrays
%            defined for 'bnd_rect_corner1' and 'bnd_rect_corner2' in case of
%            different boundary types on the domain.
