function p = plot_leafvertex_data(grid,data,params)
%function p = plot_leafvertex_data(grid,data,params)
% plot method for data on the leaf level of the grid.
%
% Currently only implemented for 2D. A patch plot is performed, such that the
% vertices have corresponding values as given by data, the values in between
% are interpolated by MATLAB.
%
% Return values:
%  p: this is the list of handles to the graphics primitives
%
% See also: plot_vertex_data() for optional params fields
