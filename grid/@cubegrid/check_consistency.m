function res = check_consistency(grid)
%function res = check_consistency(grid)
%
% function checking the consistency of a cubegrid, i.e. checking, whether
% - all elements have axis parallel edges
% - the volume of the leaf-elements corresponds to the level-0 elements
%
% Return values:
%  res: This is 1 if OK, 0 if error
%
% @note The check is slow, as all edges for all elements are determined in
% loops and multiply
