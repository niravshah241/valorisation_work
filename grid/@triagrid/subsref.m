% function allowing access to member-variables of triagrid
% this simplifies use remarkably, although also some 
% private member-variables can be read, so data-capsulation is 
% slightly violated by this. lternative would be to provide around 
% 20 methods for access to all data fields. Therefore this is the
% better compromise.
