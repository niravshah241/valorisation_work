%function res = lincomb_sequence(seq,sigma)
%
% function performing a linear combination of the elements in the
% cell array seq with coefficients in sigma result is a
% vector/matrix the same size as the entries of seq.
% if sigma = 0, the component is not touched, i.e. the component
% may also be an empty matrix.
