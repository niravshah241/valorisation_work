function [unique_vectors, count] = count_column_frequency(vectors)
%function [unique_vectors, count] = count_columns_frequency(vectors)
%
% function removing duplicates from the matrix "vectors" (which
% contains columnwise vectors) and determining the frequency of the
% vectors. i.e. unique_vectors(:,i) appeared count(i) times in the
% original list.
%
% The implementation is "expensive" by a double loop. Could be optimized.
