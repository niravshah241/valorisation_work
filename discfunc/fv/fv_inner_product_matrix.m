function W = fv_inner_product_matrix(model,model_data)
%function W = fv_inner_product_matrix(model,model_data)
%
% function computing the l2 inner product matrix for fv-functions
% on the grid.
% By this function, inner products between functions can be
% computed by their DOF vectors: K = U1' * W * U2;
