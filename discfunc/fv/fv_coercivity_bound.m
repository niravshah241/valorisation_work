function alpha = fv_coercivity_bound(model)
%function alpha = fv_coercivity_bound(model)
% 
% function determining the coercivity-alpha value of the implicit
% operator of the current simulation and current parameters.
%
% currently only for implicit diffusivity with linear dependence on
% k. In more general case, extension must be performed.
%  
% required fields of model:
% alpha_over_k : alpha is assumed to depend linearly on diffusivity k
%                value can be determined by fv_estimate_coercivity_alpha.m
%                and dividing it by k
