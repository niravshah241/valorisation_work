function [INC, b_I] = fv_explicit_space(model,model_data,U,NU_ind)
% function INC = fv_explicit_space(model, model_data, U, [NU_ind])
%  
% function applying an FV-space-discretization operator starting from old
% values U corresponding to the geometry given in grid producing a
% new vector of elementwise scalars NU but only on for the
% subelements with numbers given in NU_ind. If NU_ind is empty, all
% new values NU are determined, i.e. length(NU) = length(U) =
% grid.nelements
%
% By this, the operator evaluation can be performed in a localized
% way, i.e. used for empirical interpolation in rb_nonlin_evol_simulation
%
% usual timestepping can be performed afterwards by (NU = Id - deltat *
% INC). 
%
% required fields of model:
%   verbose                  :   a verbosity level
%   fv_expl_conv_weight      : factor for the explicit part of the convective
%                              discretization operator of the scheme 
%   fv_expl_diff_weight      : factor for the explicit part of the diffusion
%                              discretization operator of the scheme 
%   fv_expl_react_weight     : factor for the explicit part of the reaction term
%                              of the scheme
