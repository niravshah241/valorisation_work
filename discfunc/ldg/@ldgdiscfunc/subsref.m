%
% function allowing access to member-variables of df
% this simplifies use remarkably, although also some 
% private member-variables can be read, so data-capsulation is 
% slighlty violated by this. lternative would be to provide around 
% 20 methods for access to all data fields. Therefore this is the
% better compromise.
%
% additionally, the operator() is overloaded: Now this is a local 
% evaluation of ldg functions. This enables identical syntax for
% evlauating analytical or discrete functions with arguments 
% (einds, lcoord, grid, params)
