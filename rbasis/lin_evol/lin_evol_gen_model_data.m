%
% Function generating large model data, i.e. grid, which is not to
% be stored in the model, but required for numerics
% The reason is, that the model is passed to all kind of routines,
% hence the model is forbidden to contain high-dimensional objects.

% I think "inner_product_matrix_algorithm" should be replaced by mass_matrix, 
% as the latter can be built generically by local_mass_matrix
% function, e.g. for ldg functions
%model_data.W    = model.inner_product_matrix_algorithm(model, model_data);
%  the following can, e.g. be set to fv_mass_matrix
model_data.W    = model.mass_matrix([], model_data.grid,[]);
