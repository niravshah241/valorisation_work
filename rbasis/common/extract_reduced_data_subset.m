%
% method which modifies reduced_data, which is the data, that will
% be passed to the online-simulation algorithm. 
% Typically, this routine only does a submatrix extraction of the Mmax, Nmax 
% sized offline-objects to produce M, N sized objects for the real simulation.
% Required fields of model:
%  N       : number of reduced basis vectors to choose
