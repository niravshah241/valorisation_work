algorithmic aspects of certified reduced basis methods for parametrized
partial differential equations. Central aspects ranging from model
construction, error estimation and computational efficiency to empirical
interpolation methods are discussed in detail for coercive problems.
More advanced aspects associated with time-dependent problems, non-compliant
and non-coercive problems and applications with geometric variation
are also discussed as examples.},

abstract="Many applications from science and engineering are based on parametrized evolution equations and depend on time--consuming parameter studies or need to ensure critical constraints on the simulation time. For both settings, model order reduction by the reduced basis approach is a suitable means to reduce computational time. The method is based on a projection of an underlying high--dimensional numerical scheme onto a low--dimensional function space. In this contribution, a new software framework is introduced that allows fast development of reduced schemes for a large class of discretizations of evolution equations implemented in Dune. The approach provides a strict separation of low--dimensional and high--dimensional computations, each implemented by its own software package RBmatlab, respectively Dune-RB. The functionality of the framework is exemplified for a finite--volume approximation of an instationary linear convection--diffusion problem.",
