abstract="Many applications from science and engineering are based on parametrized evolution equations and depend on time--consuming parameter studies or need to ensure critical constraints on the simulation time. For both settings, model order reduction by the reduced basis approach is a suitable means to reduce computational time. The method is based on a projection of an underlying high--dimensional numerical scheme onto a low--dimensional function space. In this contribution, a new software framework is introduced that allows fast development of reduced schemes for a large class of discretizations of evolution equations implemented in Dune. The approach provides a strict separation of low--dimensional and high--dimensional computations, each implemented by its own software package RBmatlab, respectively Dune-RB. The functionality of the framework is exemplified for a finite--volume approximation of an instationary linear convection--diffusion problem.",
