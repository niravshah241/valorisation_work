abstract = {Abstract This paper describes the development of a heat transfer model with the purpose of studying the heat flows in the hearth of an operating blast furnace. Temperature profiles were calculated for a period of time to study the transition from steady blast furnace operation to an unsteady period, and back to a steady period. This total time period had the highest lining temperatures registered since the beginning of the current campaign. It was concluded that no part of the lining had an inner temperature higher than the critical temperature of 1150 °C. Thus, no refractory could have been in direct contact with slag or iron. The corner between the wall and the bottom was identified to be the most sensitive part of the lining. It is suggested that thermocouples are installed in this area, to improve the temperature control.}

abstract="Model order reduction (MOR) has become an important tool in the design of complex high-tech systems. It can be used to find a low-order model that approximates the behavior of the original high-order model, where this low-order approximation facilitates both the computationally efficient analysis and controller design for the system to induce desired behavior. This chapter introduces MOR techniques that are designed especially for coupled problems, meaning that different physical phenomena are simulated in conjunction with each other. The method developed makes use of the reduction of the individual systems, and low rank approximations of the coupling blocks. This is done in such a way that existing software for industrial problems can be adapted in a straightforwward way. An industrial test case is described in detail, so as to demonstrate the effectiveness of the reduction technique.",

abstract="This paper describes PRIMA, an algorithm for generating provably passive reduced order N-port models for RCL interconnect circuits. It is demonstrated that, in addition to requiring macro- model stability, macromodel passivity is needed to guarantee the overall circuit stability once the active and passive driver/load models are connected. PRIMA extends the block Arnoldi technique to include guaranteed passivity. Moreover, it is empirically observed that the accuracy is superior to existing block Arnoldi methods. While the same passivity extension is not possible for MPVL, we observed comparable accuracy in the frequency domain for all examples considered. Additionally, a path tracing algorithm is used to calculate the reduced order macromodel with the utmost efficiency for generalized RLC interconnects.",

The main aim is to give an overview of the most used methods to deal with the nonlinearities due to the thermo-elastic--viscoplastic laws of the involved materials and to the contact condition with the bottom block. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methods, some academic tests adapted to the difficulties arising in casting processes are presented. Applications of the techniques proposed to aluminium casting processes are discussed and numerical results are given.",
