function [vel,lambda] = velocity_affine_decomposed(glob, model)
%function [vel,lambda] = velocity_affine_decomposed(glob, model)
%
% function evaluating a function in the list of global coordinates
% specified in the columns of glob. Result is a matrix of velocity
% vectors as columns of vel.
%
% the function is given by function pointer to components and coefficients:
%    model.velocity_coefficients_ptr
%                  Function must
%                  allow call U = f(model)
%                  Return is a vector of length Q with (parameter
%                  dependent) coefficients in U.
%    model.velocity_components_ptr 
%                  Functions must
%                  allow call U = f(glob,model)
%                  Return of components is a cell array of matrices of
%                  the same size as glob with the point values
%                  of the components. 
%
% Linear combination of components by coefficients then yields the
% complete evaluation.
